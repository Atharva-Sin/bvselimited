              Biosafety cabinets, also known as biological safety cabinets, are enclosed, ventilated laboratory workspace areas designed to protect the user and surrounding environment from pathogens. All exhaust air is HEPA filtered to remove hazardous agents such as viruses and bacteria. Biosafety cabinets are used in many laboratories including clinical and research labs. Biosafety cabinets are divided into three classes: I, II and III. Class I provides protection for the user and surrounding environment, but no protection for the sample being manipulated. Class II provides protection for the user, environment and sample, and is divided into four types: A1, A2, B1 and B2. The main differences are their minimum inflow velocities and exhaust systems. Class III, also known as glove boxes, provides maximum protection; the enclosure is gas-tight, and all materials enter and leave through a dunk tank or double-door autoclave. Choice of cabinet therefor depends on level of protection needed for the laboratory worker and the sample of interest.
              There are multiple biological safety cabinet classes. But what are they and how are they different? Biological safety cabinet classes (or biosafety cabinet classes) are categories describing how the cabinet works and what it protects. These “categories” are Class I, Class II and Class III.
